  This review focuses on the determinants of longevity in the industrialized world, with emphasis on results
  from recently established data bases. Strong evidence is now available that demonstrates that in developed countries
  the maximum lifespan as well as the mean lifespan have increased substantially over the past century.
  There is no evidence of a genetically determined lifespan of around 85 years. On the contrary, the biggest absolute
  improvement in survival in recent decades has occurred amongst 80-year-olds. Approximately one-quarter of the variation
  in lifespan in developed countries can be attributed to genetic factors. The influence of both genetic and environmental
  factors on longevity can potentially be modified by medical treatment, behavioural
  changes and environmental improvements. Keywords: centenarians, life expectancy, lifespan, mortality.

introduction: >
    The determinants of longevity might be expected to be well understood. The duration of life has captured the attention
    of many people for thousands of years; an enormous array of vital-statistics data are available for many centuries.
    Life-span is easily measured compared with other health phenomena, and in many countries data are available on
    whole populations and not just study samples. Knowledge concerning determinants of human longevity, however, is
    still sparse, and much of the little that is known has been learned in recent years. This review focuses on genetic,
    environmental and medical factors as determinants of longevity in developed countries and discusses alternative paradigms
    concerning human longevity.

    Longevity can be studied in numerous ways; key\nquestions include the following. How long can a human live ?
    What is the average length of life ? Are\n\nthe maximum and average lengths of life approaching limits ?
    Why do some individuals live longer than\n\nothers ? In addressing these questions, it is useful to study the maximum lifespan actually achieved
    in\nvarious populations, the mean lifespan, and the\nvariation in lifespan.\nEstimating the maximum lifespan of human beings\nis
    simply a matter of finding a well-documented case\n\nreport of a person who lived longer than other well-\ndocumented cases.
    The assessment of mean lifespan\n\nin an actual population requires that the study\npopulation is followed from birth
    to extinction. An\nalternative approach is to calculate age-specific death\nrates at some point in time for a population,
    and then\nuse these death rates to determine how long people\nwould live on average in a hypothetical population\nin w
    hich these death rates prevailed over the course\nof the people’s lives. This second kind of mean\nlifespan is generally
    known as life expectancy. The\nlife expectancy of the Swedish population in 1996 is\nthe average lifespan that would
    be achieved by the\n1996 birth cohort if Swedish mortality rates at each\nage remained at 1996 levels for the entire
    future life\nof this cohort.\nAssessment of determinants of life expectancy and\nvariation in lifespan amongst individuals
    rely on\ndemographic comparisons of different populations\nand on such traditional epidemiological designs as\n\nfollow-up
    studies of exposed or treated versus non-\nexposed or nontreated individuals. Designs from\n\ngenetic
    epidemiology – such as twin, adoption and\nother family studies – are useful in estimating the\nrelative importance of
    genes and environment for the\nvariation in longevity.
