  This review focuses on the determinants of longevity in the industrialized world, with emphasis on results
  from recently established data bases. Strong evidence is now available that demonstrates that in developed countries
  the maximum lifespan as well as the mean lifespan have increased substantially over the past century.
  There is no evidence of a genetically determined lifespan of around 85 years. On the contrary, the biggest absolute
  improvement in survival in recent decades has occurred amongst 80-year-olds. Approximately one-quarter of the variation
  in lifespan in developed countries can be attributed to genetic factors. The influence of both genetic and environmental
  factors on longevity can potentially be modified by medical treatment, behavioural
  changes and environmental improvements. Keywords: centenarians, life expectancy, lifespan, mortality.

introduction: >
    The determinants of longevity might be expected to be well understood. The duration of life has captured the attention
    of many people for thousands of years; an enormous array of vital-statistics data are available for many centuries.
    Life-span is easily measured compared with other health phenomena, and in many countries data are available on
    whole populations and not just study samples. Knowledge concerning determinants of human longevity, however, is
    still sparse, and much of the little that is known has been learned in recent years. This review focuses on genetic,
    environmental and medical factors as determinants of longevity in developed countries and discusses alternative paradigms
    concerning human longevity.

    Longevity can be studied in numerous ways; key\nquestions include the following. How long can a human live ?
    What is the average length of life ? Are\n\nthe maximum and average lengths of life approaching limits ?
    Why do some individuals live longer than\n\nothers ? In addressing these questions, it is useful to study the maximum lifespan actually achieved
    in\nvarious populations, the mean lifespan, and the\nvariation in lifespan.\nEstimating the maximum lifespan of human beings\nis
    simply a matter of finding a well-documented case\n\nreport of a person who lived longer than other well-\ndocumented cases.
    The assessment of mean lifespan\n\nin an actual population requires that the study\npopulation is followed from birth
    to extinction. An\nalternative approach is to calculate age-specific death\nrates at some point in time for a population,
    and then\nuse these death rates to determine how long people\nwould live on average in a hypothetical population\nin w
    hich these death rates prevailed over the course\nof the people’s lives. This second kind of mean\nlifespan is generally
    known as life expectancy. The\nlife expectancy of the Swedish population in 1996 is\nthe average lifespan that would
    be achieved by the\n1996 birth cohort if Swedish mortality rates at each\nage remained at 1996 levels for the entire
    future life\nof this cohort.\nAssessment of determinants of life expectancy and\nvariation in lifespan amongst individuals
    rely on\ndemographic comparisons of different populations\nand on such traditional epidemiological designs as\n\nfollow-up
    studies of exposed or treated versus non-\nexposed or nontreated individuals. Designs from\n\ngenetic
    epidemiology – such as twin, adoption and\nother family studies – are useful in estimating the\nrelative importance of
    genes and environment for the\nvariation in longevity.

  Numerous extreme long-livers have been reported in various mountainous regions, including Georgia, Kashmir, and Vilcabamba.
  In most Western coun- tries, including the Scandinavian countries, excep- tional lifespans have also been reported.
  Examples are Drachenberg, a Danish–Norwegian sailor who died in 1772 and who claimed that he was born in 1626,
  and Jon Anderson, from Sweden, who claimed to be 147 years old when he died in 1729. There is no convincing documentation
  for these extreme long- livers. When it has been possible to evaluate such reports, they have proven to be very improbable [1, 2].
  In countries, like Denmark and Sweden, with a long tradition of censuses and vital statistics, re- markable and sudden
  declines in the number of extreme long-livers occur with the introduction of more rigorous checking of information on age
  of death, as the result of laws requiring birth certificates, the development of church registers and the es- tablishment of
  statistical bureaus [3, 4]. This suggests that early extreme long-livers were probably just cases of age exaggeration.
  Today (March 1996), the oldest reported well- documented maximum lifespan for females is 121 years [5] and for males 113 years [6].
  Both these persons are still alive. Analyses of reliable cases of long-livers show that longevity records have been repeatedly
  broken over past decades [3, 6]; this suggests that even longer human lifespans may occur in the future.
  There has been surprisingly little success in identi- fying factors associated with extreme longevity. A variety of centenarian
  studies have been conducted during the last half century. As reviewed by Seger- berg [7], most of the earlier studies were based on
  highly selected samples of individuals, without rigorous validation of the ages of reputed centen- arians. During the last decade several
  more com- prehensive, less selected centenarian studies have been carried out in Hungary [8], France [9], Finland [10] and Denmark [11].
  A few specific genetic factors have been found to be associated with extreme longevity. Takata et al. [12] found a significantly
  lower frequency of HLA-DRw9 amongst centenarians than in an adult control group in Japan, as well as a significantly higher
  frequency of HLA-DR1. The HLA-antigens amongst the Japanese centenarians are negatively associated with the presence of autoimmune
  diseases in the Japanese population, which suggests that the association with these genetic markers is mediated through a lower
  incidence of diseases. More recently, both a French study [13] and a Finnish study [14] found a low prevalence of the e4 allele of
  apolipoprotein E amongst centenarians. The e4 allele has consistently been shown to be a risk factor both for coronary heart disease and for
  Alzheimer’s dementia. In the French study [13], it was also found that centen- arians had an increased prevalence of the DD- genotype of
  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) compared with adult controls. This result is contrary to what was expected as the DD-genotype of
  ACE has been reported to be associated with myocardial infarction. Only a few genetic association studies concerning extreme longevity have been published ;
  the associations described above need to be replicated in future studies. Amongst environmental factors, even such an obvious
  candidate as nonsmoking has failed to be associated with extreme longevity. For example, the world’s oldest man has smoked for most of his
  life and still smokes cigars regularly [6]. This should not be taken as evidence of the harmlessness of smoking : the influence
  of many risk factors attenuates when studied in older people. For smoking, the underlying explanation is likely to be that individuals
  for whom smoking was a severe health hazard (due to genetic make-up or other risk factors) have died well before the most advanced ages.
  The individuals surviving to extreme ages are particularly robust and either are not very susceptible to the health hazards of
  smoking or have compensating characteristics [15, 16]. Studies of alcohol consumption and diet through life, as well as physical activity,
  have also failed to show consistent association with attainment of extreme age [8–11].
  History provides numerous examples of medical treatments claimed to yield a long and healthy life. However, none of these claims has been proven.
  In recent years, studies of humans have indicated that blood level of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate ester (DHEAS) are inversely
  correlated to mortality. Furthermore, these ‘ weak androgens ’ have shown association with various objective and subjective
  health measurements in elderly persons [17, 18]. Clinical trials are now under way to test this medication and its influence on ageing.
  The discussed determinants of extreme lifespan are listed in Table 1.
